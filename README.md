During my spare time as a 1st year at The University Of Leicester I self taught Javascript and then Node js with Express js. Once I learnt these technologies I've created a backend web application built around cigars.

With Node & Express JS I've managed to:

- Allow the user, known as the customer, to register an account
- Allow the user to log in and stay logged in using passport module
- Store user details within mySQL database
- Store the users password using a password-hashing algorithm known as bcryptjs within the DB
- Incorporate JUnit testing with supertest
- Incorporate Logging with Winston
- Allow the user to delete its account
- Allow the user to change its accounts password
- Allow the user log out of its account
